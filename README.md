Users should be able to:

### Screenshot

![](/screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### What I learned

I was able to learn grid template row and column

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
.main{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr 1fr;
    gap:1rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    height: 100vh;
    overflow: hidden;
}

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://fonts.google.com/) - I was able to import fonts from google fonts.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/bento-grids-in-web-design/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand bento grid. It explains the origin of bento grid and also guides you on how to start your project I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
